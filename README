For quick installation from a distribution tar file
-----------------------------------------------------------------
starting in the directory containing the tar file:
>  tar zxf flaps-XXX.tar.gz
will create a directory "flaps-XXX", the Flaps root directory.

If this is the first time installing Flaps it may be necessary to
install certain packages; the PACKAGES in the Flaps root directory
can be run as a script like this:
> yes | sudo PACKAGES
note that it is usually necessary to run it as superuser with sudo.
PACKAGES will try to determine if this Linux uses apt or rpm for
package management.

Once you have the necessary packages installed all you should have
to do is
>  cd flaps-XXX
>  . ./Profile
>  ./configure
>  make install

If this is successful you can run some tests:

>  cd demo
>  run all

If the build is not succesful it may be because some packages
were not installed, or it may be necessary to adjust environment
variables that are set when Profile is "sourced".
Or maybe it is time to text or email
